# Create with Code 2

Welcome to my **Create with Code 2** repository! This repository contains all the projects, scripts, and assets I create while working through Unity Learn's "Create with Code 2" course. This course is helping me build on my Unity skills and learn intermediate game development techniques.

## Overview
This repository serves as my workspace for experimenting with new Unity features, practicing scripting, and completing course challenges. Each module introduces new concepts and provides opportunities to apply them in fun and creative ways.

## Course Modules
Here is an outline of the modules and topics I am covering during the course:

### 1. **Game Mechanics**
- Developing advanced player controls and AI behaviors.
- Creating power-ups and hazards to make gameplay more dynamic.

### 2. **Advanced Physics**
- Using Unity's physics system for realistic interactions.
- Building challenging environments with obstacles.

### 3. **Game Design Principles**
- Learning level design, gameplay balancing, and progression systems.
- Enhancing user experience with feedback loops and polish.

### 4. **Polishing**
- Adding sound effects, animations, and particle systems.
- Designing user interfaces with menus, buttons, and visual elements.

### 5. **Final Project**
- Combining everything I've learned to create a polished, playable game.
